# Ocaml Monkey

## Description

This is the Ocaml implementation of the Monkey Language, as described by Thorsten Ball in his book ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/)

## Purpose

Whereas Go is a nice language, I am courageous enough to try challenges as writing an interpreter, but lazy enough to copy-paste the code from the book instead of really put my mind into it.
Using a different language, even more so a *very different* language was an elegant solution to this personal problem.

Besides, Ocaml is one of the coolest language that exists!
